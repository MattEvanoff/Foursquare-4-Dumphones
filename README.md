# Foursquare-4-Dumphones
Stupid simple interface for checking into Foursquare - meant for dumbphone use

I made this project years ago for my friend who still had a dumbphone after the rest of us had upgraded.  

This allows someone to checkin using Foursquare and even post it to Facebook using suuuuper simple interface.  It even has a location search which uses goggle to do geo-location. It has a leaderboard, mainly so they can choose a location from their friends recent checkins.  

I have no idea if it still works.  Googgle now requires https for their maps API, and my server is not setup for that, so I can't really test it, but seeings as I just downgraded to a dumb phone, this came back to mind, and I figured I would post it.
